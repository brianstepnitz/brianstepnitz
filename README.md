## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. My name is Brian Stepnitz. I am a father, hobbyist, student, and volunteer located in the Baltimore-Washington metro area of Maryland, USA.

I am also an experienced software engineer and systems analyst. I thrive in research and development environments where pioneering research meets practical applications. My core passions include modeling and simulation, machine learning, and data science.

I am eager to contribute to a dynamic, dedicated team to deliver innovative, impactful solutions for complex, analytical challenges. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about technology, research, or analysis.

Thanks for looking and have a wonderful day!
